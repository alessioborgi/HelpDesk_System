PROJECT SCOPE: Implementation of a Ticketing System, that embraces both the Database and the Application Side Implementation.

PROJECT RESULTS:
• Implementation through PostgreSQL of 59 entities describing the HelpDesk Company. 
• Focus on Employee Category (Leadership, Technicians (1-st level and second level), Managers (Account and Business), Cross-Functionals( HR and Finance) ).
• Focus on Employee Benefits (Food, Courses, Car, Books, Stock Options, Credit-Card, PC, Phone, 
 and IPAD.
• Focus on the relationship with External Companies, that allow the HelpDesk Company to handle their 
 Customer Service Side. 
• Focus on the Customer, that has the most important role in the Project( Ticket-Report-Convalidation 
 scheme. The Customer will open a Ticket, the HelpDesk Team will work to fix the incident making intervents (to which corresponding reports) that must be validated by the Customer, that has the power to confirm that the issue is solved before the ticket is closed. 
• Checking for some restrictions through SQL Triggers and Functions. 
• Implementation of about 50 nested queries.

• Implementation also of an Application Side, through two main applications(Python, Site).
• Made available a Python-based GUI, directly linked with the DB, through which we distinguish 7 
 main Employee areas (linked to a Login Implementation), with different options depending on the 
 category. 
• Inclusion of a sort of "Admin" power, conferred to the Leadership Team, that can navigate 
 throughout all the areas, in addition to some special operations, it can do (Operating Profit, etc...).
• Made available a (PHP-HTML-CSS)-based site through which we provide three different app-side 
 (Customer, Technicians, Leadership Employees).
• Customer Satisfaction Implementation (Comment and Starred-Feedback).
